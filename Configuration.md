## 9. Create Custom Rule for Mimikatz Detection
1. On Wazuh Manager, navigate to:
   ```bash
   cd /var/ossec/etc/rules
   ```
2. Create a new custom rules file:
   ```bash
   sudo nano custom-rules.xml
   ```
3. Add the following rule for Mimikatz detection:
   ```xml
   <group name="mimikatz,attack,malware">
     <rule id="100001" level="15">
       <decoded_as>json</decoded_as>
       <field name="win.system">EventID: 1</field>
       <description>Potential Mimikatz execution detected</description>
     </rule>
   </group>
   ```
4. Save the file and restart Wazuh Manager.
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl restart wazuh-manager
   ```

## 10. Configure Shuffle for Wazuh Alerts
1. Open **Shuffle**.
2. Keep the **Changeme** icon as it is.
3. Add a **webhook** to receive alerts from Wazuh Manager.
4. Use this webhook to automate alerts forwarding and integrations with TheHive.

## 11. Prerequisites

Ensure you have the following components installed and configured:

- **Wazuh Manager** (For collecting and analyzing security events)
- **Shuffle** (For SOAR automation)
- **TheHive** (For case management and threat intelligence)

   - Configure it to listen for incoming Wazuh alerts.
   - Parse the alert JSON to extract relevant information.

## 14. Automating Threat Intelligence with VirusTotal

1. Add the **VirusTotal app** in Shuffle.
2. Configure it to extract file hashes, IPs, or URLs from Wazuh alerts.
3. Use the VirusTotal API to check if the entity is malicious.
4. Store the response in Shuffle for further processing.

## 15. Creating an Incident in TheHive

1. Add **TheHive app** in Shuffle.
2. Create an action to automatically generate a case in TheHive if an alert meets specific criteria (e.g., high severity, multiple detections).
3. Map Wazuh alert fields to TheHive case attributes.

## 16. Sending Email Notifications

1. Add the **Email App** in Shuffle.
2. Configure SMTP settings for outgoing alerts.
3. Automate email notifications for critical alerts, including threat intelligence results and incident details.

## 17. Testing the Workflow

1. Trigger a test alert in Wazuh (e.g., run `logger "Test Wazuh Alert"`).
2. Verify that Shuffle receives the webhook.
3. Check if VirusTotal enriches the data.
4. Ensure TheHive logs the case correctly.
5. Confirm that email notifications are sent.

## 18. Configure TheHive for Alert Management

- **Define the Alert Fields:**
  - PAP (Permissible Actions Protocol): Set exposure level.
  - Severity: Set as `2` for moderate severity.

  - Source Reference: Use Rule ID (e.g., `1002`).
  - Status: Set as `New`.
  - Summary: Provide context, e.g., "Mimikatz activity detected on host."
  - Host Information: Retrieve host details from the alert.
  - Process ID & Command Line: Extract relevant details.
  - Tags: Add MITRE ATT&CK mapping (e.g., `T1003 - Credential Dumping`).
  - Title: Set dynamically, e.g., "Mimikatz Detected".
  - Traffic Light Protocol (TLP): Set as `2` (Green/Restricted Sharing).
  - Alert Type: Mark as **Internal**.

   - **Timestamp (UTC)**
   - **Affected Host Name**
   - **Process ID & Command Line**
5. **Run the Workflow:**
   - Confirm email receipt with the necessary details.

## 22. Set Up a Virtual Machine for Testing (Ubuntu)

2. Allow all **TCP connections** to simulate an attack scenario.
3. Create a firewall rule to allow inbound **SSH connections** for testing.

## 23. Detect SSH Brute Force Attacks & Automate Blocking

1. Add **HTTP Application** in Shuffle.
2. Define a **GET API Action** with a `curl` request to fetch logs from Wazuh.
3. Extract **Source IP Addresses** from unauthorized SSH attempts.
